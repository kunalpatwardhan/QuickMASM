# QuickMASM
Quick editor to write/debug MASM based assembly programs. Build in VB6

This program I build in my engineering days. To simplify assembly practices. It provides nice notepad like editor with live assembling and error gets displayed if any.  Debug button is also added to facilitate debugging of assembled program. MASM is provided with this source code.
